# FTIR Substituent Classifier

Classifying benzene derivatives as *ortho-*, *meta-*, or *para-*substituted from their IR spectra — using PCA dimensionality reduction and k-Nearest Neighbours.

Built from scratch in Python as part of a third-year physical chemistry lab at the University of Oxford.

## What it does

Takes raw ATR-FTIR spectra (`.txt` files from a Shimadzu spectrometer) and runs them through a full ML pipeline:

1. **Pre-process** — interpolate to integer wavenumbers, normalise by area, crop to fingerprint region (630–880 cm⁻¹)
2. **Reduce** — PCA from 251 wavenumber features → 20 principal components
3. **Classify** — k-NN (k=3) trained on 76 compounds, 380 spectra total (5 repeats each)
4. **Predict** — classify personally collected spectra of unknown aminobenzoic acid isomers

PCA 3D scatter clearly separates the three substitution classes, confirming the fingerprint region encodes substituent position. k-NN achieves **75–90% accuracy** on held-out test sets.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GETYCOMFORSURE/ftir-substituent-classifier.git
cd ftir-substituent-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebook/
```

Or open any notebook directly in Google Colab. Mount your Drive and point `ir_pipeline.py` at your spectra folder.

## Data

See data in `data/raw_ir_spectra/` following the naming convention `compoundname_N.txt` (e.g. `p-xylene_1.txt`). Five personally collected unknown spectra are included in `data/your_collected_spectra/`.
